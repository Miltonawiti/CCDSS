DNA Sequence Analysis and Machine Learning in Genomics
This project covers key skills in DNA sequence analysis and applying machine learning to genomics. It includes:
Genomic Predictions: Implementation of machine learning models (SVM, AdaBoost, Decision Trees, MLP, KNN, Gaussian Naive Bayes) to predict disease risk, drug response, and patient outcomes from genetic data.
Model Evaluation: Performance assessment using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Data Preprocessing: Preparation of DNA sequence data for machine learning, essential for handling high-dimensional datasets in genomics.
Model Interpretability: Analysis of model complexity versus interpretability, balancing predictive power with transparency in genomic predictions.
